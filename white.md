2024 learnings: white is not a neutral color
--------------------------------------------

I read Cliff Tan's [Feng Shui Modern](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58578770-feng-shui-modern) this year. It helped me conceptualize
better what makes interiors work or not. But the thing that stuck with me the most is that pure white is not a neutral color.
It has a pretty profound impact on the vibe of a room: clinical, formal. Not what you'd want in a home setting, at least not as a default.
That kinda blew my mind, as I had assumed that white (no colour) was the safe choice. But my eyes are open now.

I am currently repainting my home.

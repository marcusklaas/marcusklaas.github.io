2024 learnings: the best and worst veg
--------------------------------------

In 2024 I learned just how good Spinach is when it comes to the micronutrient game. Check out this table.

| Vegetable | Vitamin A (IU) | Vitamin C (mg) | Vitamin K (μg) | Folate (μg) | Iron (mg) | Calcium (mg) | Magnesium (mg) | Potassium (mg) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Spinach | 9,377 | 28.1 | 483 | **194** | **2.7** | 99 | **79** | **558** |
| Broccoli | 623 | 89.2 | 102 | 63 | 0.7 | 47 | 21 | 316 |
| Carrot | 16,706 | 5.9 | 13.2 | 19 | 0.3 | 33 | 12 | 320 |
| Sweet Potato | 14,187 | 2.4 | 2.3 | 11 | 0.6 | 30 | 25 | 337 |
| Cauliflower | 0 | 48.2 | 15.5 | 57 | 0.4 | 22 | 15 | 299 |
| Kale | 9,990 | 120 | **704** | 141 | 1.5 | **150** | 47 | 491 |
| Bell Pepper | 3,131 | **127.7** | 4.9 | 46 | 0.4 | 7 | 12 | 211 |
| Brussels Sprouts | 754 | 85 | 177 | 61 | 1.4 | 42 | 23 | 389 |
| Eggplant | 23 | 2.2 | 3.5 | 22 | 0.2 | 9 | 14 | 229 |

I never realized how well it scores across the board. And it puts down the best score 4 categories.

It seems we are wasting our time telling ourselves to eat veg as a blanket statement and should focus on Spinach instead.

This also confirms my long-held belief that eggplant is a garbage veg that should be avoided. And that there's no point
in working through the soggy mess that it is for the nutrients either.

Bonus points for Spinach for tasting reasonably good, and for cooking in like 2 minutes. If you even want to
cook it at all, because you don't even have to.

Spinach has hereby been crowned the absolute veg champ.
